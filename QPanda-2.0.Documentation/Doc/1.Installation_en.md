# QPanda 2.0 Installation



Thank you for using the Quantum Development Kit of QPanda 2.0, which contains the tools needed to build your quantum computing programs and experiments. It is hard to get started with quantum computing where the people had no background in quantum theory. During this, we provide the reference code and explanation of the quantum algorithm with QPanda, to help beginners build their quantum programs as soon as possible.

We hope that users can make sense of quantum computing through this documentation, and can quickly integrate into the large group of quantum computing to develop new quantum programs. By the way, we welcome you to provide exciting quantum programs and valuable feedback.

Usually, please check the installation instructions first. If you need to refer to the basics and tutorials of quantum computing, please link to http://intro.qubitonline.cn/ (only Chinese available)to expand the relevant knowledge, which will help you to better use QPanda 2.0, or other online reference, try google something, you will get more.





## 1. Installation and configuration

The C++  language is used as the host language in QPanda 2.0. Therefore, it is necessary to configure the C++ development environment.The installation configuration is temporarily based on Windows in this case.


### Installation Development Environment

1.  At frist, Please download 'Visual Studio 2017' from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/. Recommend to download Visual studio professional 2017. (Note: install the latest version if necessary)
