# QPanda 2.0 Installation



Thank you for using the Quantum Development Kit of QPanda 2, which contains the tools needed to build your quantum computing programs and experiments. It is hard to get started with quantum computing where the people had no background in quantum theory. During this, we provide the reference code and explanation of the quantum algorithm with QPanda, to help beginners build their quantum programs as soon as possible.

We hope that users can make sense of quantum computing through this documentation, and can quickly integrate into the large group of quantum computing to develop new quantum programs. By the way, we welcome you to provide quantum programs and valuable feedback.

Usually, please check the installation instructions first. If you need to refer to the basics and tutorials of quantum computing, please link to http://intro.qubitonline.cn/ (only Chinese available)to expand the relevant knowledge, which will help you to master QPanda 2, or other online reference in English.





## 1. Installation and configuration
